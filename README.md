# Gerrit browse plugin

Like vim-rhubarb, but for a Gerrit git server instead of than GitHub.

Enables `:GBrowse` to work for Gerrit-enabled repositories.

When you are using Gerrit, your commit message contains: "Change-Id: [GUID]"

And you can convert the remote of the repo into an https URL to show that change.
